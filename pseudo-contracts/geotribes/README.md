# Geotribes

[Geotribes](https://github.com/dougbutner/web-4#geosocial-systems-geotribes--geodomains) are a concept described by cXc founder Douglas Butner. These contracts are the first known geotribal system, and will serve to create a global cXc geotibe, as well as smaller cXc geotribes  


# Contracts 
tribe.cxc - Houses lists of current tribes and members
council.cxc - Record of council meetings, funds + funds dispersed
geo.cxc - Decentralized list of primitives, including lists of geopolitical stratification
